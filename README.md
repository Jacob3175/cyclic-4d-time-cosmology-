# Cyclic 4D-Time Cosmology

This repository contains LaTeX source, compiled drafts, and reproducible figures for a conceptual cosmological model in which the **fourth dimension (time)** is treated as a bounded, cyclic arc. In this framework, cosmic expansion begins at a quantum bounce, ends at a turnaround, and repeats. The model integrates Loop Quantum Cosmology–style quantum corrections to avoid singularities and introduces a geometric mechanism for large-scale turnaround.

## Summary
- **Time as a closed arc**: expansion begins at the bounce (minimum scale factor), ends at a turnaround (maximum scale factor), and loops back.  
- **Bounce mechanism**: quantum corrections inspired by Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC).  
- **Turnaround mechanism**: introduced via closed-time geometry (or negative Λ/curvature).  
- **Single-frame bounce state**: the bounce is interpreted as a quantum state with no relative frames.  
- **Reproducible figures**: all plots are generated by `make_figs.py`, which solves the effective Friedmann equation, finds bounce/turnaround points, computes the cycle period, and produces `a(τ)` and `H²(a)` directly from the dynamics.
