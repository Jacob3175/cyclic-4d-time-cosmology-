# Cyclic 4D-Time Cosmology

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.16935007.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16938896)

This repository contains LaTeX source, compiled drafts, and reproducible figures for a conceptual cosmological model in which the **fourth dimension (time)** is treated as a bounded, cyclic arc. In this framework, cosmic expansion begins at a quantum bounce, ends at a turnaround, and repeats. The model integrates Loop Quantum Cosmologyâ€“style quantum corrections to avoid singularities and introduces a geometric mechanism for large-scale turnaround.

## ðŸ”‘ Summary
- **Time as a closed arc**: Expansion begins at the bounce (minimum scale factor), ends at a turnaround (maximum scale factor), and loops back.  
- **Bounce mechanism**: Quantum corrections inspired by Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC).  
- **Turnaround mechanism**: Introduced via closed-time geometry (negative Casimir-like term, or equivalently curvature/negative Î›).  
- **Single-frame bounce state**: The bounce is interpreted as a quantum state with no relative frames.  
- **Entropy and arrow of time**: Compact time may enforce holographic entropy bounds ($S \leq A/4G\hbar$), preventing monotonic entropy buildup and resetting entropy each cycle.  
- **Observational outlook**: Predicts potential signatures in CMB low-â„“ multipoles (â„“ â‰ˆ 20â€“30) and oscillatory features in the primordial gravitational wave spectrum, testable with Planck data and next-generation detectors (LISA, Cosmic Explorer).  
- **Reproducible figures**: All plots are generated by `make_figs.py`, which solves the effective Friedmann equation, finds bounce/turnaround points, computes the cycle period, and produces $a(\tau)$ and $H^2(a)$ directly from the dynamics.
