# Cyclic 4D-Time Cosmology

This repository contains a starter paper and figures for a toy cosmological model
in which the **fourth dimension (time)** is cyclic and bounded. The closed time loop
controls both the start of expansion (bounce) and the end (turnaround).

## Key Ideas
- **Time as a closed arc**: expansion begins at the bounce (minimum scale factor), ends at the turnaround (maximum scale factor), and loops back.
- **Bounce mechanism**: inspired by Loop Quantum Cosmology (quantum corrections avoid singularity).
- **Turnaround mechanism**: built into time’s geometry (no external trigger needed).
- **Single-frame bounce state**: at the bounce, all matter/forces exist in one quantum frame with no relative dilation.

## Files
- `main.tex` – LaTeX draft of the research note.
- `figures/plot_a_tau.png` – cyclic scale factor example.
- `figures/plot_H2.png` – effective Friedmann showing bounce and turnaround (toy).
