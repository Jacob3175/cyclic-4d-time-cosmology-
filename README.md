This repository contains notes, LaTeX source, and figures for a conceptual cosmological model in which the **fourth dimension (time)** is treated as a bounded, cyclic arc. In this framework, cosmic expansion begins at a quantum bounce, ends at a turnaround, and repeats. The model integrates Loop Quantum Cosmology–style quantum corrections to avoid singularities and introduces a geometric mechanism for large-scale turnaround.

## Summary
- **Time as a closed arc**: expansion begins at the bounce (minimum scale factor), ends at a turnaround (maximum scale factor), and loops back.  
- **Bounce mechanism**: quantum corrections inspired by Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC).  
- **Turnaround mechanism**: introduced via closed-time geometry (or negative Λ/curvature).  
- **Single-frame bounce state**: the bounce is interpreted as a quantum state with no relative frames.
